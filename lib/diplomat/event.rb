    # @note
    #   Events are sent via the gossip protocol; there is no guarantee of delivery
    #   success or order, but the local agent will store up to 256 events that do
    #   arrive. This method lists those events.
    #   It has the same semantics as Kv::get, except the value returned is a list
    #   i.e. the current value is all events up until now, the next value is the
    #   current list plus the next event to arrive.
    #   To get a specific event in the sequence, @see #get
    #   When trying to get a list of events matching a name, there are two possibilities:
    #   - The list doesn't (yet) exist / is empty
    #   - The list exists / is non-empty
    #   The combination of not_found and found behaviour gives maximum possible
    #   flexibility. For X: reject, R: return, W: wait
    #   - X X - meaningless; never return a value
    #   - X R - "normal" non-blocking get operation. Default
    #   - X W - get the next value only (must have a current value)
    #   - R X - meaningless; never return a meaningful value
    #   - R R - "safe" non-blocking, non-throwing get-or-default operation
    #   - R W - get the next value or a default
    #   - W X - get the first value only (must not have a current value)
    #   - W R - get the first or current value; always return something, but
    #           block only when necessary
    #   - W W - get the first or next value; wait until there is an update

    # @note
    #   Whereas the consul API for events returns all past events that match
    #   name, this method allows retrieval of individual events from that
    #   sequence. However, because consul's API isn't conducive to this, we can
    #   offer first, last, next (last + 1) events, or arbitrary events in the
    #   middle, though these can only be identified relative to the preceding
    #   event. However, this is ideal for iterating through the sequence of
    #   events (while being sure that none are missed).
